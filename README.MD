# Hands-on go and mongoDB

This repo was created to follow the Hands on training with go and mongoDB.

The project and some notes will be stored here as I move on in the training.

## Dependencies

### MongoDB

MongoDB can be started from docker:

`docker run --name mongodb -p 27017-27017 -d mongo`
